Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the branch of computer science of designing,  developing, testing, deploying and maintaining softwares
- Its importance includes: Increases efficiency and productivity, ensures software maintainability, supports technical innovation and enhances software quality


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Birth of software engineering. This was a response to the software crisis, where projects were plagues by delays, cost overruns and poor quality software.
- Rise of structured programming - As software complexity grew, structured programming became a widely accepted methodology.
- Emergence of Agile and DevOps and AI - DevOps, Agile and AI emerged, Integrating development and operations teams to automate deployment, enhance collaboration and  accelerate software delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Defining project scope, objectives, budget and timeline.
Requirements gathering - gathering and documenting of user needs and system analysis.
Design -  Develops software architecture, data models and user interface design.
Implementation - Developers write the actual code based on design documents.
Testing - Verifies that the software meets the specified requirements.
Deployment - Release of the software is done to production or end users.
Maintenance - Provides ongoing bug fixes, updates and enhancements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- In waterfall methodology, it is sequential and linear whereas in Agile methodology, steps are iterative and incremental.
- Waterfall methodology is rigid, difficult to change requirements once development starts wherea agile methodology is highly flexible and changes can be incorporated during development.
- In waterfall methodology, the entire project is delivered at the end whereas in agile methodology, functional parts of the project are delivered incrementally.

- Waterfall is best fr projects with well-defined and fixed requirements and short term projects with clear objectives.
- Agile methodology is best for projects with evolving requirements, Software as a service(Saas) applications and fast paced and innovation-driven projects.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer is responsible for writing, testing and maintaining software applications based on project requirements.
- A quality assurance engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards before release by identifying and resolving bugs or inconsistencies.
- A project manager oversees the software development process, ensuring that the project is completed on time, withing scope and within a budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs are important as they help with debugging and testing, code editing and syntax highlighting, project management as well as build and deployment tools.
- Examples of IDEs include: VS Code, JetBrains IntelliJ, PyCharm, Android Studio.
- Version control Systems help developers track changes in code, collaborate efficiently and revert to previous versions when necessary.
- Examples of VCS include Git, Github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Managing complexity - We can overcome this by use of modularity, design patterns and software architecture best practices.
- Debugging and Troubleshooting - Use debugging tools, logging and systematic testing to identify and fix issues.
- Keeping up with new technologies - Engage in continuous learning, attend developer conferences and take online courses
- Code quality - Use code reviews, automated design and static analysis tools.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing is done by testing individual components or functions of the code.
- It's importance is that it helps catch bugs early, ensuring each unit works.

- Integration testing is testing done to ensure the interaction between different modules to ensure they work together. It's importance is that it detects interface mismathces, data flow issues and integration errors.

- System testing is testing done to the entire system as a whole, verifying that it meets functional and non-functional requirements. It's importance is that it ensures the application behaves as expected in a real-world environment.

- Acceptance testing is the testing that evaluates the system's compliance with business requirements often performed by  end users. It's importance is that it determines if the software is ready for release


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the process of crafting precise and effective instructions (prompts) to optimize the output of AI models. It's importance includes enhancing AI response quality, reduces ambiguity, improves efficiency, enables customizatiion

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-"Tell me about history". - It lacks specificity. It lacks which part of history, a specific country, a certain period.
- The improved prompt should be something like "Provide a summary of World War 2, including its causes, major events and consequences in under 200 words. This would be more effective as it has a clear topic, structured request and a word limit as well.
